    <h3 class="w3-center">Dear Fellow Mustangs, </h3>
    <p>I am Hyacinth Sharmeen Zia and feeling extremely honoured to be able to do so, I take this opportunity to announce my candidacy for the USC Representative Senate to work towards the ideal of an equitable, just, knowledge-based society and to serve you with dedication and devotion, to the best of my abilities.</p><br>
    <p>I come from a South Asian background; to be precise, I was born in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, to Bangladeshi Muslim parents. I lived in the densely populated old part of the city, where everybody knew everybody. I grew up in a joint family with my grandmother, uncles, aunts and cousins. We shared our food and clothing, and it was not infrequent for my cousins and me to spend many of our days and nights in each other’s company at one of our houses. There I learned what we now call empathy, sharing and caring for others, and most importantly, the values of bonding and togetherness. These are the values we need to promote and instill in society, and therefore these values will be at the top of my campaign mission.</p><br>
    <p>The old part of the city that shaped my childhood was also dotted with mosques, temples, and churches. On every occasion, be it Hindu, Muslim or Christian festivals, we used to participate, soak in the festivities and celebrate. For us there was no ‘other’. Suspicion, hatred, and mistrust stem from the lack of knowledge, communication, and understanding. Much of racism and communal violence in the world has its roots in the lack of empathy and this lack of empathy comes from lack of knowledge. The value that I would like to uphold for my campaign is respect for all religious and ethnic minority groups. I would like to urge everyone through my campaign to help change our mindset of 'us vs. them'.</p><br>

        <br><br><br><p>We live in a knowledge-based world, a world that is also fast-paced and constantly changing. What is relevant today may become obsolete tomorrow. Our education system has to adapt to the changes, create facilities for a new frontier of knowledge. We need to create a support system for students to remain relevant in the changing world. Last but not least, we need to make the principle of sustainability an integral part of our lives. As the saying goes, ‘waste not; want not’. Our resources are limited and we have to be prudent in using them.</p><br>
        <p>The beauty of the world is in its diversity, but its sustainability comes from unity. My campaign slogan is celebrating diversity in unity. Join me in my attempt to make a world that is better for us, for today and for tomorrow!</p>
